My attempt to implement some parts of the C++ Standard Library.
This is purely for my own interest - it would not be a good idea to use this in your own code base!

For simplicity, I am using websites such as cplusplus.com and cppreference.com as references for
signatures and behaviours, instead of the spec itself, so the implementation may not be
completely correct in some edge cases.

Since this is a personal learning exercise, I have also prioritised writing and testing
code over documentation.
